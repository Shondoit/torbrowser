<h1>Tor Browser Bundle</h1>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Tor Browser.exe is a 7zip self extracting archive. To extract the
bundle, run this and point it to the install location. It will create
a folder called "Tor Browser". This may be the hard disk, but is more
likely the currently mounted USB drive. The install process needs only
be performed once.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Once the bundle is extracted, open the newly created folder and
click "Tor Browser.bat" (may appear as simply "Tor Browser"). This
will start Vidalia. Once Tor has successfully opened a circuit,
Firefox will automatically be opened.</p>

<p>To exit, close Firefox. Vidalia will automatically clean up and
exit.</p>
