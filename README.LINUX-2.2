This will create a directory named tor-browser_LANG. Click on this directory or
cd into it and execute the 'start-tor-browser' script. This will start Vidalia.
Once Tor has successfully opened a circuit, Firefox will automatically be

To exit, close Firefox. Vidalia will automatically clean up and exit.
