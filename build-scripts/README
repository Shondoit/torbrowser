Building Tor Browser.exe
========================

To build Tor Browser.exe, you need to have built:
 Vidalia and Tor (in /c/build/vidalia and /c/build/tor-<version> by default)
 FirefoxPortable (in ./FirefoxPortable/ by default)

Vidalia needs to have the BrowserExecutable option enabled (currently in
trunk).

FirefoxPortable can be downloaded from:
 http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable

7zip can be downloaded from:
 http://www.7-zip.org/download.html

Customization
-------------

The locations of Qt, MinGW32, the Vidalia/Tor build directory, 7zip,
FirefoxPortable can be altered in Makefile.

Building the bundle
-------------------

Firefox must not be running while you are building the bundle

Run "make bundle"

To specify a different language configuration, set $LANGCODE,
e.g. "LANGCODE=fa make bundle" or "LANGCODE=zh-cn make bundle"

To compress it, run "make compress-bundle"

Archived code
-------------

The patch to Vidalia can be found in archive/. This has now been
applied to the Vidalia trunk, so is no longer needed.
