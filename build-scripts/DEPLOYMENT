This document describes how the official Tor Browser Bundle is
deployed. It is probably not of interest outside of the Tor Project.

Building the test bundle
========================

It is a good idea to build just one bundle, since doing the final
build for all languages takes about 1 hour

Read INSTALL to set up the environment

Check that you are using the latest version of any of the bundle
components (OpenSSL, zlib, libevent, Firefox, Pidgin, Vidalia, Tor)

Edit the Makefile:

 - Update the location of any packages which have changed

 - Update the VERSION variable for the new release

 - Update the location of MOZILLA_LANGUAGE for whatever version of
   FirefoxPortable that you are using

Run:
 $ make reallyclean
 $ USE_PIDGIN=1 make compressed-bundle_de split-bundle_de

This will take around 10 minutes

Initial check
=============

Try out tor-browser-..._de.exe and tor-browser-..._de_split.part01.exe

Make sure that Firefox, Pidgin and Torbutton work and are in the right
language

Note, if at this stage you find out that Firefox starts with a new tab
saying that it has been upgraded, you will need to update
config/prefs.js and set the "extensions.lastAppVersion" variable

If you made any changes, go back to "Building the bundle"

Building all the bundles
========================

Once you are happy everything is building correctly, run:
 $ make reallyclean
 $ make all-bundles-both

This will take around 1 hour

Update README
=============

Update the section "Included applications" with the new version
numbers.

In the section "Changelog", add the new version number if it is not
already there, update the release date and add in what has changed in
this version.

To make sure you have not missed anything, compare the changelog to
the results of:

 svn diff \
  https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbrowser/tags/torbrowser-$LASTVERSION/ \
  https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbrowser/trunk/

Tag the build
=============

Tag the trunk to the correct version number (e.g. torbrowser-1_1_0):

 svn cp \ 
  https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbrowser/trunk/ \
  https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbrowser/tags/torbrowser-$NEWVERSION/

Export the source tarball
=========================

In build-scripts, run "make srcdist"

The source will be put into /tmp/tor-browser-$NEWVERSION-src.tar.gz

Sign everything
===============

Copy the files from Windows to the machine with your OpenPGP keys

Sign them all using the "gpg -ab" command:
 find . -type f -exec gpg --use-agent -ab {} \;

Move the split signatures to a directory:
 for i in *_split; do mkdir $i/signatures; mv $i/*.asc $i/signatures;done

Upload to www.torproject.org
============================

Copy the files, along with their signatures to:
 www.torproject.org:/var/www/www.torproject.org/htdocs/torbrowser/dist

Make sure they have the right permissions:
 find /var/www/www.torproject.org/htdocs/torbrowser/dist -type f -exec chmod 444 {} \;
 find /var/www/www.torproject.org/htdocs/torbrowser/dist -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \;

Update the website
==================

Edit https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/website/trunk/include/versions.wmi

Update version-torbrowser* with the versions of the bundles and
components

Ask Roger to publish the website
