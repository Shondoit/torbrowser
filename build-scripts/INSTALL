- Building Firefox


Building Tor Browser Bundle
===========================

To build Tor Browser Bundle, you need to have built:
 Vidalia (in /c/build/vidalia by default)
 Tor (in /c/build/tor-<version> by default)
and have uncompressed Firefox Portable
 FirefoxPortable (in ./FirefoxPortable/ by default)

Instructions for building Vidalia and Tor are included below.

To compress the bundle and build the self-extracting executable you
need to have installed 7zip.

Vidalia needs to have the BrowserExecutable functionality. Currently
this is only available in the Vidalia trunk.

FirefoxPortable can be downloaded from:
 http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable

7zip is needed to compress the bundle can be downloaded from:
 http://www.7-zip.org/download.html

Customization
-------------

The locations of Qt, MinGW32, the Vidalia/Tor build directory, 7zip,
FirefoxPortable can be altered in Makefile.

Building the bundle
-------------------

Firefox must not be running while you are building the bundle.

Run "make bundle"

To specify a different language configuration, set $LANGCODE,
e.g. "LANGCODE=fa make bundle" or "LANGCODE=zh-cn make bundle"

To compress it, run "make compress-bundle"


Building Vidalia
================

Full instructions are in the Vidalia INSTALL file.

Building under MSYS
-------------------

Add the following to /etc/profile:
 export QTDIR="C:\Qt\4.3.2"
 export PATH=$PATH:/c/Qt/4.3.2/bin
 export QMAKESPEC=win32-g++

Then run:
 $ cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" .
 $ make

Building under MinGW32
----------------------

Qt and CMake must be in the %PATH%. An easy way to do this is to
copy qtvars.bat and add the path to CMake. Then, copy the shortcut
from the Start menu, and edit the path to point to the altered
qtvars.bat

Then run:
 > cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" .
 > mingw32-make

Patches
-------

The patch to add the BrowserExecutable option is in:
 ../src/archived-patches/vidalia-startbrowser.patch
As of Vidalia revision 2207, this patch is now integrated and so no
longer needs to be applied manually:
 http://trac.vidalia-project.net/changeset/2207

A patch to close the Browser when Vidalia exits is in:
 ../src/current-patches/vidalia-killbrowser.patch
This is not yet useful, since killing FirefoxPortable does not cause
Firefox to exit. This patch has not yet been applied to Vidalia.


Building OpenSSL, zlib, libevent and Tor
========================================

Full instructions in:
 https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/tor/trunk/doc/tor-win32-mingw-creation.txt

Uncompressing OpenSSL shows a number of errors concerning symlinks.
These do not appear to have caused a problem.

For zlib, use the first option (zlib.a)

For libevent, use 1.3e, as suggested by the document above.
libevent 1.4.0 is newer but untested.

It is tor-resolve, not tor_resolve.exe

Autoconf 2.56 appears to work fine (2.59 is mentioned in the instructions)


Building Firefox
================

Currently the Tor Browser Bundle uses FirefoxPortable binaries.
Eventually it should use a custom build of Firefox. 

Tested compilers
----------------

MinGW32 cross compile under Linux:
 Failed to work (unsupported by Mozilla)
MSVC 8 (Visual Studio .NET 2005):
 Failed to work (unsupported by Mozilla for Firefox 2, but should work
 for Firefox >=3)
 With some patches it may be possible to build Firefox 2:
  http://georgedexter.wordpress.com/2007/03/03/building-firefox-2002-on-windows/
MSVC 7.1 (Visual Studio .NET 2003):
 Works, provided  msvcp71.dll and msvcr71.dll are copied

For more information see:
 http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Windows_Build_Prerequisites
 http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Build_and_Install

Instructions for MSVC 7.1
-------------------------

- Install MSVC 7.1 (Visual Studio .NET 2003) and upgrade using Microsoft Update

- Download Platform SDK from
  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=0baf2b35-c656-4969-ace8-e4c0c0716adb

- Install MozillaBuild from
  http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/libraries/win32/MozillaBuildSetup-1.1.exe

- Run e:\mozilla-build\start-msvc8.bat

  $ cd "e:\mozilla\build"
  $ tar -xjvf ../firefox-2.0.0.9-source.tar.bz2
  $ cd mozilla
  [ dot_mozconfg is in config/ ]
  $ cp ../dot_mozconfig .mozconfig
  $ make -f client.mk build

- Copy msvcp71.dll and msvcr71.dll from "Microsot Visual Studio .NET 2003\Visual
  Studio .NET Professional 2003 - English" to obj-i686-pc-mingw32\dist\bin

- Add "msvcp71.dll" and "msvcr71.dll" to browser/installer/windows/packages-static

$ make -C obj-i686-pc-mingw32/browser/installer
