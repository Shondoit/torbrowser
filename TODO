Vidalia modifications
---------------------

- Make Vidalia show some evidence of activity while it is starting Tor
[mid priority -- what do you have in mind here?]

- Prevent user from starting Firefox manually while Tor is still
  starting up
  OR (preferably)
- Allow normal Firefox and Tor Browser to co-exist safely
[mid priority]

- Also make Vidalia show what percentage progress Tor has made in
  building a circuit (needs Tor to send events while startup is proceeding)
  - Tor should send out more status_event messages based on various
    milestones towards its circuit-establishment phase.
  - Vidalia should recognize these and either change the text for
    "Tor is starting up", or have a status bar, or something.
[high priority]

- Make Vidalia kill Firefox when it exits. Currently Vidalia
  terminates the process, but killing FirefoxPortable does not end Firefox.
  Either we could kill firefox.exe directly, or wait until Vidalia
  launches Firefox.
  Let's wait until Vidalia launches Firefox directly. -RD

- Implement UPNP
  Perhaps based on this library http://search.cpan.org/src/SKONNO/Net-UPnP-1.2.1/

Firefox modifications
---------------------

- Produce new branding so we don't infringe on the Mozilla trademarks
[ Instructions here http://kb.mozillazine.org/Rebranding_Firefox ]
[mid priority]

- Get FirefoxPortable building
[mid priority]

- Eventually try to remove NSIS dependency for FirefoxPortable and
  move any necessary code into Vidalia. See docs/ToaST-startup.txt
  for what we will want to do.
[low priority]

- Tailor error messages so are more appropriate to Tor (e.g. point out
  dangers when submitting forms to non-HTTPS URLs)
[low priority]

- Check if Torbutton behaves as intended if pre-configures by prefs.js

General
-------

- Use process monitor to watch filesystem activity:
  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/utilities/processmonitor.mspx

  [ Vidalia doesn't appear to alter the registry other than the RNG
    seed and MountPoints2. Tor does this too, so can it be stopped? 
    Firefox/FirefoxPortable alters other keys (Audio Compression
    Manager, Tcpip\Parameters, Shell Folders, Internet Settings) ]
[low priority]

- What should the installer look like (should it have the Tor logo)?
  We need to be clear in the documentation about the difference between
  the installer and the actual bundle
[mid priority]

- Modify Torbutton to prevent user from disabling Tor (easily)
[mid priority]

- Ensure Firefox update works securely
[low priority]

- Investigate updating Tor automatically
[low priority]

- Add ToaST-like bootstrap mode/other pre-caching/disk-caching
  performance improvements (and understand the bottleneck)

- Move "installer" to something more usable (NSIS?)
  - Set default extraction location the Desktop
  - Allow it to be translated
  - Make the directory selector clearer (not "...")

- Split archive or make auto-downloader to help people who cannot
  download large files in one go

- Ask specific vendors to sign their packaged binary releases, probably with
  pgp/gpg. The packages are: 7zip, MinGW, MSYS, CMake, QT, msysDTK,
  zlib, FirefoxPortable

  Letters requesting package signatures have been sent to: zlib, MinGW, MSYS, 
  CMake

  Soon letters will be sent to:
  QT, msysDTK, FirefoxPortable

  A forum post requesting package signatures have been posted for 7zip:
  http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=4982530

Questions
=========

- Firefox 3 will not support Windows prior to XP. Is this a problem for
our target audience?

Done
====

[ Done: 2008-05-27 ]

- If we can't make a static build of Vidalia, produce a small
  executable to launch Vidalia (so the top level folder doesn't have
  random DLLs lying around)
[mid priority]

- Because the batch file cannot have an icon other than the default windows
  icon, perhaps we should abandon the batch file and use a windows specific
  shortcut. This would allow us to use the Vidalia icon and Vidalia will do all
  of the work that the batchfile once did. This may not work if shortcuts are 
  all absolute.

[ Done: 2008-02-15 ]

- Make it easier to include optional Firefox extensions

[ Done: 2008-01-30 ]
- Make Vidalia start and stop Polipo too
[high priority]

[ Done: 2008-01-22 ]
- Make a web page for bundle

[ Done: 2007-12-12 ]
- Add bookmarks that will help people understand tor better
  - The Tor frontpage
  - A hidden service of some sort?
  - A "check if your Tor is leaking" page
[low priority]

[ Done: 2007-12-12 ]
- Build Tor myself
[high priority]

[ Done: 2007-12-12 ]
- Add version numbers to builds
[mid priority]

[ Done: 2007-12-13 -- I think users should be able to stop (and
  restart Tor) without exiting Firefox. I've added the code to kill
  the browser when Vidalia exits but this won't work until
  PortableFirefox is replaced with Vidalia. ]
- What to do when user clicks "Stop Tor" or exits Vidalia: Don't let them do it?
  Kill Firefox? Show a helpful message?
  We could make Vidalia change its button labels when it has launched Firefox
  for us, to make it clearer what clicking "stop tor" and "exit" will do.

[ Done: 2007-12-19 -- it does guess, but this isn't good for a
portable bundle ]
- Check whether Vidalia auto-detects language if not specified. If
  this is likely to guess right, then maybe we should not specify in
  the config file.
[high priority]

[ Done: 2007-12-19 -- as of r12876 ]
- Let us build a Simplified-Chinese and Farsi version. These
  would have Vidalia and Firefox configured to use these languages
  by default.
[top priority]

  * We need a better Farsi translation in that case
  Once we have it working reasonably well, we should bug our Farsi-speaking
  friends (for example, our friends at IBB) for help.

[ Done: 2007-12-20 ]
- Investigate how to programmatically add extensions and modify
  preference files (partially complete).
  Adding them to user.js will override user modifications (sometimes
  not good).
  Adding them to all.js is better, but entries must be sorted (are
  there other constraints?)

   [ Sorting them didn't work -- there is more magic here ]

   Extensions we want:
    Torbutton [important]
     https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2275
     [We should use the latest dev version of this -RD]

    Adblock Plus
     https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865
    ChatZilla
     https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/16

    ErrorZilla Mod
     https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3336
     [Once we have polipo, it will be the one providing error
      messages. Does that make this extension moot? I think so. -RD]
    Flush Tor Circuit [superseded by Vidalia]
     ?
    NoScript [probably superseded by Torbutton]
     https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/722
[high priority]

- Decide what preferences to set and what extensions to pre-install
  [ xB use this: http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Nov-2007/msg00227.html ]
[high priority]

- Restore some/all Firefox settings on exit
  For example, if the user turned off Torbutton.
  We should accumulate other examples here.
[mid priority]

[ Done 2007-12-25 -- it's the "Tor Browser Bundle" ]

- Come up with a new name
