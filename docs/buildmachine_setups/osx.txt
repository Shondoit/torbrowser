Documentation for the setup of macx86.torproject.org

Install Mac OS X Lion 10.7, get all updates.

Download XCode 4.2.1 from
https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action, install. This puts
an Install Xcode.app into your applications, manually run the contained
installer script (don't just run the .app). It is in
Contents/MacOS/Install Xcode.

Fetch macports from http://www.macports.org/install.php - choose the
Lion installer, install. This will change your PATH variable via your
~/.profile file. Run sudo port selfupdate.

First off, we need a bit of software, so install it:

	sudo port install git-core wget cmake autoconf213 yasm

This will probably prompt you to install java stuff, do it.

Create a new limited (non-admin) "macx86builder" User to do the builds.

Create a new directory, /builds, and chown it to macx86builder.

sudo to macx86builder

	"sudo -u macx86builder -i"

Then run these:

	cd /builds/
	git clone https://git.torproject.org/torbrowser
	cd torbrowser
	git checkout maint-2.2
	cd build-scripts
	make -f osx.mk build-all-binaries copy-firefox bundle
