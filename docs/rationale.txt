Altering FirefoxPortable
------------------------

The .ini file needs to have "WaitForFirefox=true" set, since otherwise
the launcher will exit immediately after starting Firefox. Currently
we rely on detecting Firefox closing for when to shut down Tor.

Design suggestions from IBB
---------------------------

- Is looking like IE (as ToaST does) good for security

  IBB's answer: browser frames are small and subtle compared to
  the page that's actually being displayed. They'll ask some people,
  but until they say to worry about it, don't worry about it.

- Is having a splash screen likely to attract unwanted attention

  IBB's answer: Yes; don't do that. Even the Vidalia control panel
  will become recognizable over time. We should help users learn that
  they can hide it on subsequent runs. Hopefully the onion in the
  system tray will be both a) adequate for knowing Tor's status, and
  b) not very recognizable.

  [SJM - OK, I've disabled the splash screen. There is now a few
   second pause between the green onion and the browser window.
   Hopefully this will be OK.]

- How big can USB Tor be on disk/when downloaded

  IBB's answer: 128 meg usb keys are the default these days. So a 
  20-30 meg download is fine. More than that is bad.

  [SJM - Currently we are at a 12 MB download and it's 48 MB on disk]

- Should we cache directory information on the USB device/hard disk

  IBB's answer: if Tor's already on the media, then putting more stuff
  there isn't a problem. But don't put it on the hard drive if Tor is
  on the USB key. Roger told them it would be a big win for startup
  time.

- How much of a worry is wearing out the flash

  IBB's answer: don't worry about it. We should continue to improve
  features like Tor's AvoidDiskWrites if there turns out to be an
  issue either with read/write speed or with wearing out.
