Vidalia modifications
---------------------

- Make Vidalia start and stop Polipo too
[high priority]

- Make Vidalia show some evidence of activity while it is starting Tor
[mid priority -- what do you have in mind here?]

- Prevent user from starting Firefox manually while Tor is still
  starting up
[mid priority]

- Also make Vidalia show what percentage progress Tor has made in
  building a circuit (needs Tor to send events while startup is proceeding)
  - Tor should send out more status_event messages based on various
    milestones towards its circuit-establishment phase.
  - Vidalia should recognize these and either change the text for
    "Tor is starting up", or have a status bar, or something.
[high priority]

- Make Vidalia kill Firefox when it exits. Currently Vidalia
  terminates the process, but killing FirefoxPortable does not end Firefox.
  Either we could kill firefox.exe directly, or wait until Vidalia
  launches Firefox.
  Let's wait until Vidalia launches Firefox directly. -RD

Firefox modifications
---------------------

- Produce new branding so we don't infringe on the Mozilla trademarks
[mid priority]

- Get FirefoxPortable building
[mid priority]

- Eventually try to remove NSIS dependency for FirefoxPortable and
  move any necessary code into Vidalia. See docs/ToaST-startup.txt
  for what we will want to do.
[low priority]

- Tailor error messages so are more appropriate to Tor (e.g. point out
  dangers when submitting forms to non-HTTPS URLs)
[low priority]

- Check if Torbutton behaves as intended if pre-configures by prefs.js

General
-------

- Use process monitor to watch filesystem activity:
  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/utilities/processmonitor.mspx

  [ Vidalia doesn't appear to alter the registry other than the RNG
    seed and MountPoints2. Tor does this too, so can it be stopped? 
    Firefox/FirefoxPortable alters other keys (Audio Compression
    Manager, Tcpip\Parameters, Shell Folders, Internet Settings) ]
[low priority]

- If we can't make a static build of Vidalia, produce a small
  executable to launch Vidalia (so the top level folder doesn't have
  random DLLs lying around)
[mid priority]

- If we can make a static build of Vidalia, make it look for the
  config file in a different directory
[? priority]

- Come up with a new name
[top priority]

- What should the installer look like (should it have the Tor logo)?
  We need to be clear in the documentation about the difference between
  the installer and the actual bundle
[mid priority]

- Modify Torbutton to prevent user from disabling Tor (easily)
[mid priority]

- Ensure Firefox update works securely
[low priority]

- Investigate updating Tor automatically
[low priority]

- Add ToaST-like bootstrap mode

Questions to ask
----------------

- Is looking like IE (as ToaST does) good for security

  IBB's answer: browser frames are small and subtle compared to
  the page that's actually being displayed. They'll ask some people,
  but until they say to worry about it, don't worry about it.

- Is having a splash screen likely to attract unwanted attention

  IBB's answer: Yes; don't do that. Even the Vidalia control panel
  will become recognizable over time. We should help users learn that
  they can hide it on subsequent runs. Hopefully the onion in the
  system tray will be both a) adequate for knowing Tor's status, and
  b) not very recognizable.

  [SJM - OK, I've disabled the splash screen. There is now a few
   second pause between the green onion and the browser window.
   Hopefully this will be OK.]

- How big can USB Tor be on disk/when downloaded

  IBB's answer: 128 meg usb keys are the default these days. So a 20-30
  meg download is fine. More than that is bad.

  [SJM - Currently we are at a 12 MB download and it's 48 MB on disk]

- Should we cache directory information on the USB device/hard disk

  IBB's answer: if Tor's already on the media, then putting more stuff
  there isn't a problem. But don't put it on the hard drive if Tor is
  on the USB key. Roger told them it would be a big win for startup
  time.

- How much of a worry is wearing out the flash

  IBB's answer: don't worry about it. We should continue to improve
  features like Tor's AvoidDiskWrites if there turns out to be an
  issue either with read/write speed or with wearing out.

Done
====

[ Done: 2007-12-12 ]
- Add bookmarks that will help people understand tor better
  - The Tor frontpage
  - A hidden service of some sort?
  - A "check if your Tor is leaking" page
[low priority]

[ Done: 2007-12-12 ]
- Build Tor myself
[high priority]

[ Done: 2007-12-12 ]
- Add version numbers to builds
[mid priority]

[ Done: 2007-12-13 -- I think users should be able to stop (and
  restart Tor) without exiting Firefox. I've added the code to kill
  the browser when Vidalia exits but this won't work until
  PortableFirefox is replaced with Vidalia. ]
- What to do when user clicks "Stop Tor" or exits Vidalia: Don't let them do it?
  Kill Firefox? Show a helpful message?
  We could make Vidalia change its button labels when it has launched Firefox
  for us, to make it clearer what clicking "stop tor" and "exit" will do.

[ Done: 2007-12-19 -- it does guess, but this isn't good for a
portable bundle ]
- Check whether Vidalia auto-detects language if not specified. If
  this is likely to guess right, then maybe we should not specify in
  the config file.
[high priority]

[ Done: 2007-12-19 -- as of r12876 ]
- Let us build a Simplified-Chinese and Farsi version. These
  would have Vidalia and Firefox configured to use these languages
  by default.
[top priority]

  * We need a better Farsi translation in that case
  Once we have it working reasonably well, we should bug our Farsi-speaking
  friends (for example, our friends at IBB) for help.

[ Done: 2007-12-20 ]
- Investigate how to programmatically add extensions and modify
  preference files (partially complete).
  Adding them to user.js will override user modifications (sometimes
  not good).
  Adding them to all.js is better, but entries must be sorted (are
  there other constraints?)

   [ Sorting them didn't work -- there is more magic here ]

   Extensions we want:
    Torbutton [important]
     https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2275
     [We should use the latest dev version of this -RD]

   Extensions we might want (from xB Browser and ToaST):
    Adblock Plus
     https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865
    ChatZilla
     https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/16

    ErrorZilla Mod
     https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3336
     [Once we have polipo, it will be the one providing error
      messages. Does that make this extension moot? I think so. -RD]
    Flush Tor Circuit [superseded by Vidalia]
     ?
    NoScript [probably superseded by Torbutton]
     https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/722
[high priority]

- Decide what preferences to set and what extensions to pre-install
  [ xB use this: http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Nov-2007/msg00227.html ]
[high priority]

- Restore some/all Firefox settings on exit
  For example, if the user turned off Torbutton.
  We should accumulate other examples here.
