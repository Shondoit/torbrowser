Filesystem modifications
========================

To study what changes Firefox portable makes I started two instances
of Windows in VMWare, from the same base. In one I ran Tor Browser
Bundle and in the other I ran nothing. By comparing the filesystem
states I was able to find out which files changed.

33 files changed in each instance, 32 of which are common to both
runs.

When the Tor Browser Bundle was run this file was modified:
 
 WINDOWS/system32/wbem/Repository/FS/INDEX.BTR

When Tor Browser was not run this file was modified.

 WINDOWS/Prefetch/WUAUCLT.EXE ... .pf

The former is part of the Windows logging infrastructure, so needs to
be investigated as to whether there is any sensitive information
stored.

The latter file indicates that Windows update ran, which is probably
just a coincidence. Some more investigation to confirm this would be
advisable.

Also, the application was run from a USB drive. The situation could
also be different if the application was run from the hard drive.

Prefetch
--------

If there are less than 128 entries in WINDOWS/Prefetch on reboot, and
sufficient time has passed since booting, the starting of any
executable will create a new file in that location. File names are of
the form <COMMAND>-<HASH>.pf.

There appears to be no difference when the bundle is run from
removable storage as opposed to the hard disk. 

Future steps
============

These tests were run on a computer which already had Firefox
installed. It is possible that without Firefox the situation will be
different.
